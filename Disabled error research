To properly define a resource like disable_fapolicy_service in another Chef cookbook, you can use a custom resource. This is the modern and recommended way to create reusable blocks of Chef code.
Here are the steps to define a custom resource:
1. Create the Custom Resource File
In your cookbook (let's call it fapolicy_cookbook), you'll create a new directory and file structure: resources/disable_fapolicy_service.rb.
 * fapolicy_cookbook/
   * resources/
     * disable_fapolicy_service.rb
   * metadata.rb
   * ... (other cookbook files)
2. Write the Custom Resource Code
Inside the disable_fapolicy_service.rb file, you define the resource's properties and actions.
# fapolicy_cookbook/resources/disable_fapolicy_service.rb

# The name of the resource (matches the file name)
resource_name :disable_fapolicy_service

# Define the default action for the resource
default_action :run

# Define any properties the resource takes (e.g., a name)
property :name, String, name_property: true

# Define the :run action
action :run do
  # This is where you put the actual code to disable the service.
  # Use Chef's built-in resources to perform the work.

  # Example using the 'service' resource:
  service 'fapolicyd' do
    action :stop
  end

  service 'fapolicyd' do
    action :disable
  end
end

3. Use the Custom Resource
Once the custom resource is defined and your cookbooks are properly configured, you can call it from any recipe that depends on fapolicy_cookbook.
In your main cookbook's metadata.rb:
# my_main_cookbook/metadata.rb
name 'my_main_cookbook'
version '0.1.0'

# Declare the dependency on the cookbook containing the custom resource
depends 'fapolicy_cookbook'

In your main cookbook's recipe (my_main_cookbook/recipes/default.rb):
# my_main_cookbook/recipes/default.rb

# Call the custom resource by its name.
disable_fapolicy_service 'disable the fapolicy daemon'
